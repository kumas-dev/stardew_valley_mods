"Strings.Piratesnote.1": "January 15th, 18XX ^^Ahoy, Today be a day to mark in me log, for I stumbled upon a hidden gem amidst this treacherous sea. Me ship narrowly escaped the clutches of those dastardly enemy pirates. To safeguard me precious treasure, I found meself a sanctuary hidden away in the depths of a sea cavern.^^^^With the tide at its lowest and the moon casting a Mystical glow upon the waters, I cautiously made me way into the cavern, guided only by a flickering torch. The air was thick with the scent of salt and adventure, and the sound of waves crashing against the cavern walls echoed in me ears. The anticipation of the unknown stirred me pirate heart, for I knew this place held secrets untold.^^^^As I ventured deeper into the cavern, the dim light danced upon the walls, revealing glimmers of gold, silver, and precious gems. It was a true treasure trove, a sight to behold!^^^^Yet, as I gazed upon the riches that lay before me, a cold wind blew through the cavern, whispering tales of the misfortune that befell those who dared to covet these treasures. Stories of lost souls and cherished memories echoed in me mind.^^^^Word be spreadin' that the king's fleet be on our trail. They've caught wind o' our recent escapades, and we be needin' to disappear into the mist afore they lay their eyes on us. I concealed some of me recent plunder behind a formidable rock wall, turned me back, and made me hasty retreat. Avast ye! I swear on me timbers, I be swearin' to sail back to this marvellous cave one day, but should I be snared by the scurvy dogs, to the soul who lays eyes on this parchment, me booty be hidden in the cavern nearest to the mighty briny deep. Look for a telltale mark on the cavern wall, And mind ye, only the mightiest of pickaxes can break through. May the wind be at yer back, and the stars guide ye to the riches concealed within.^^^^- Captain Black Siren",

Not by mortal eyes, but by an enigmatic presence that dwells within these cavern walls.^^It brings to mind the choices I've made, the paths I've taken, and the treasures I've sought. Oh, how the past haunts me still. The name, Captain Black Siren, carries with it the heavy weight of me past self, and I wonder if redemption can ever truly be found.^^The sea and the wind call me back to the ship with an urgency I cannot ignore. I must set sail, leaving the mysteries of this cavern behind for now.^^^^-Captain Black Siren",
