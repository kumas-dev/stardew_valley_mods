Better Balance (ver 1.2.2)
by Xen0nex 

Welcome to my first attempt at a published mod; a wide-ranging rebalancing of prices for various farm produce.


:::::REQUIREMENTS:::::

SMAPI

Content Patcher



:::::Installation & Usage:::::

Install the latest version of SMAPI

Install the latest version of Content Patcher

Download the zipped file, and unzip its full contents into your Stardew Valley\Mods\ folder.

That's all you need to start playing, although there are some Recommended Mods & Optional Plugins detailed on the Nexus page for this mod.

In particular, this mod has expanded functionality if Custom Crystalarium Mod is also installed, which will cause the Crystalarium to clone Gems & Minerals slower for balance reasons.  If you do not have CCM installed, that portion of this mod will safely be skipped by SMAPI, and you can safely delete the "[CCRM] Better Balance" folder if you wish to avoid the "skipped mod" error message in SMAPI.

Please note while this mod should work without any issues on an existing save file (see paragraph below), the full effects of the balancing changes will be most noticeable on a new save file.  

For using with existing saves, note that while all newly generated/harvested items should have their prices adjusted accordingly, any existing items that are already in the player's inventory, or in chests, or have already been spawned by machines, animals, or on the ground as foragable items on the dawn of the in-game day you install this mod will still have the old Vanilla prices.  To fix existing items with old prices, put them in a chest and then bring a stack of 1 or more matching items with the correct new price, then pull the old items out of the chest so that they join the new items in the player's inventory, where they will convert to the new price.

The values in this mod are the result of many hours spent simulating the performance of different options, but all of this has been done according to my personal tastes for balance.  Users can make any desired adjustments by editing the content.json in "[CP] Better Balance" while referencing the readme.txt to see which items they want to change. 



:::::Configuration:::::

There are 2 config.json files, one in each of the "[CP] Better Balance" and "Better Balance" folders. 

The "[CP] Better Balance" config allows you to disable the SMAPI functionality of this mod by setting the value to "false" instead of "true". This will disable some of the other features of this mod, such as adjusting the prices and roles of Fruit Tree Saplings, or correcting the seed prices in the Stradew Valley Expanded version of the Joja Mart.

The "Better Balance" config allows you to adjust the PURCHASE prices for some of the hard-coded items, such as Fruit Tree Saplings, but only if the SMAPI functionality of this mod is not disabled. 



:::::Price Changes:::::

You can view the original and adjusted prices for the various items in the "Basic Price Changes.txt" or "SMAPI Price Changes.txt" files, depending on whether you choose to use the Basic prices or the SMAPI adjusted prices. Currently the main difference is Fruit Tree Fruit & Saplings.


:::::Changes with Stardew Valley Expanded:::::

Better Balance automatically adjusts the price bonuses you receive from various SVE-exclusive events to be more in line with Better Balance pricing. Additionally, if the SMAPI functionality of Better Balance is enabled, it will also adjust the prices of seeds at Joja stores in SVE to fit Better Balance prices. For example, this makes seeds from Jojamart cost ~10% less than Better Balance seed prics, instead of of ~10% less than Vanilla seed prices.

Below the specific price bonus amounts for the various SVE events are listed, you can skip this section to avoid spoilers.
